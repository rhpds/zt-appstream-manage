An update to the web application running on this system requires
features available in ruby 3.1. To accomplish this you will ultimately
remove ruby 3.0 and install ruby 3.1.

To start, how do you know that ruby 3.1 is availble? Additional software
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is shipped as an Application Stream.
Application Streams take several different forms, but ruby is packaged
and shipped as a module.

List the available ruby modules.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf module list ruby
----

From the above output, you can see that ruby 3.1 is available and can be
installed on the system.

In order to upgrade the system, first remove ruby 3.0.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf -y remove ruby
----

Take a look at the machine to validate the removal of ruby 3.0.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf list ruby
----

Previously, the dnf list showed ruby in the `+Installed Packages+`. Now
that it has been removed from the system, it is listed in the
`+Available Packages+`.
