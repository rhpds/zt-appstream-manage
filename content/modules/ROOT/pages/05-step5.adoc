Now that the ruby 3.1 is installed, you can also look at how the modular
package management is reported by `+dnf+`.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf module list ruby
----

From the above output, you can see that ruby 3.1 is the enabled `+[e]+`
module and that it is installed `+[i]+` on the system.

As Red Hat releases updated application streams, you will use a similar
process of removing the installed application stream and installing a
newer one.

To see the full list of available modular packaged application streams
an their versions available for your system:
