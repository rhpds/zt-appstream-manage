Now you can install ruby version 3.1 on the system. However, it is also
important to note that Application Streams often have a different
lifecycle than other packages provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
According to the RHEL 9 Aplications Streams Release Lifecycle section of
the
https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhel-app-streams-life-cycle[Application
Streams Lifecycle Page], ruby 3.1 will be retired in March 2025.

However, for our application, that is fine because we expect continued
development and will likely be upgrading to an even newer version of
ruby at some point during our application life. Go ahead and install
ruby 3.1 on the system:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo dnf -y module install ruby:3.1
----

You can verify that ruby 3.1 is now available on the system by checking
the version reported by ruby:

[source,bash,run]
----
sudo ruby --version
----
